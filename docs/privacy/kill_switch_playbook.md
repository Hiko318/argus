## 2. KILL SWITCH PROCEDURES

### 2.1 Level 1: Soft Shutdown (Preferred)

**Use when:** System integrity maintained, no immediate danger

#### 2.1.1 Web Interface Method

```bash
# Access admin panel
https://foresight-admin.local/emergency

# Login with emergency credentials
Username: emergency_admin
Password: [EMERGENCY_PASSWORD]

# Navigate to Emergency Controls
1. Click "System Emergency"
2. Select shutdown reason
3. Confirm with second operator if available
4. Click "INITIATE SOFT SHUTDOWN"
```

#### 2.1.2 Command Line Method

```bash
# SSH to control server
ssh emergency_admin@foresight-control.local

# Execute emergency shutdown
sudo /opt/foresight/scripts/emergency_shutdown.sh --soft

# Verify shutdown status
sudo systemctl status foresight-*
```

#### 2.1.3 API Method

```bash
# Emergency API call
curl -X POST https://api.foresight.local/v1/emergency/shutdown \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $EMERGENCY_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "soft",
    "reason": "privacy_breach",
    "operator": "operator_id",
    "confirm": true
  }'
```

### 2.2 Level 2: Hard Shutdown (Emergency)

**Use when:** Immediate threat, system compromise, or soft shutdown fails

#### 2.2.1 Physical Kill Switch

**Location:** Main control room, red emergency button

1. **Lift protective cover**
2. **Press and hold for 3 seconds**
3. **Confirm with biometric scan**
4. **System will shutdown within 30 seconds**

#### 2.2.2 Network Isolation

```bash
# Disconnect from network immediately
sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP
sudo iptables -P OUTPUT DROP
sudo iptables -P FORWARD DROP

# Disable network interfaces
sudo ifconfig eth0 down
sudo ifconfig wlan0 down

# Stop all network services
sudo systemctl stop networking
```

#### 2.2.3 Power Shutdown

```bash
# Immediate system halt
sudo shutdown -h now

# Or force power off
sudo poweroff --force

# For drone systems
sudo /opt/dji/scripts/emergency_land.sh
```

### 2.3 Level 3: Nuclear Option (Last Resort)

**Use when:** Complete system compromise, legal seizure imminent

#### 2.3.1 Data Destruction

```bash
# CAUTION: This will destroy all data permanently

# Secure wipe of sensitive data
sudo shred -vfz -n 3 /var/lib/foresight/biometric_db/*
sudo shred -vfz -n 3 /var/lib/foresight/video_cache/*
sudo shred -vfz -n 3 /var/log/foresight/*

# Cryptographic key destruction
